what-is-a-neural-network-text: |
  <p>An artificial neural network consists of layers of connected neurons: an input layer, middle 
  ‘hidden’ layers, and an output layer. Neural networks transform the data they receive into other 
  data. How they do this depends on connections in the network.</p>
  <p>During training, the computer itself constructs connections in the network to achieve the 
  solution of connecting the input and output correctly.</p>

what-is-training-data-title: What is training data?
training-data-text-1: |
  <p>Training data works as a basis for a neural network to function. It consists of a large amount 
  of sample data (inputs) combined with the correct solutions (outputs).</p>
  <p>Without training data, neural networks are useless. Some training data has its own databases. 
  The data from the ‘digit recognition’ example comes from the MNIST database for handwritten digits, 
  which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits.</p>
training-data-text-2: |
  <p>Training data must often be ‘cleaned’ first. In the case of digits, handwritten numbers are 
  automatically placed in the center of the image and converted into 28x28 pixels. Try it out!</p>
training-data-text-3: |
  <p>Training data also has its pitfalls—with digits, for example, the numbers 1 and 7 are written 
  in the American style. Trained networks have difficulty recognizing European style 7s, which are
  written with the addition of a center line. This is called data bias.</p> 
  <p>More on this in the deep dive!</p>
how-does-ai-learn-from-data-button: But how does AI learn from data?
how-does-a-neural-network-learn-title: How does a neural network learn?
how-does-a-neural-network-learn-text: |
  <p>At the beginning of training, a neural network knows nothing. It must first find suitable 
  weights to connect to its many neurons through trial and error. This occurs step by step during 
  the training process.</p>
  <p>With digits, the neural network’s weights are altered slightly. The network is then shown a 
  test image (input), and the result (output) of the neural network is compared with the known 
  solution. If the result is heading in the right direction, the network’s weights are further 
  adjusted in that direction. If not, the network tries something else.</p>
  <p>This is repeated with new training data until the results are satisfactory.</p>
  <p>The neural network has learned and can now apply this to new, unknown input.</p>
